# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

A simple webpage-based game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). The project started as a console-based game, to be played in the developer console, but was updated to include a webpage GUI.
